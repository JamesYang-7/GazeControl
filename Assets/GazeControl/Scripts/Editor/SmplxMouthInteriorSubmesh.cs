    /// The mouth bag authored in Blender carries no UV mapping: every one of its
    /// vertices — plus the inner-lip rim that was merged into it — is collapsed onto
    /// UV (0, 0), so the whole cavity samples a single texel, the bottom-left corner of
    /// the agent's albedo map. That corner is dark in the stock SMPL-X atlas but nearly
    /// white in the SMPLitex-generated ones, which is why the cavity read black on one
    /// agent and grey on another. Splitting it off makes the cavity texture-independent.
    ///
    /// Nothing outside the cavity uses that texel: the nearest mapped UV sits 0.029 away
    /// (15 px at 512², 120 px at 4096²), and every mouth triangle is fully unmapped —
    /// there are no partially-mapped seam triangles to disambiguate. So "all three
    /// vertices sit on UV (0, 0)" identifies the interior exactly, currently 288 of the
    /// mesh's 21196 triangles.
